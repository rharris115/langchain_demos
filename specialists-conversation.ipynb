      "1. Therapist/Counselor: They can aid in the 'Resolution of Unfinished Business', 'Acceptance of Death', 'Reconciliation', 'Release of Guilt', 'Forgiveness', and dealing with 'Love' related issues.\n",

      "2. Detective/Private Investigator: They can help in 'Uncovering Truth', and 'Retrieval of Lost Items'. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Lawyer/Judge: They can be involved in cases of 'Revenge or Justice'.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Funeral Director/Cemetery Worker: They are experts in 'Proper Burial' related matters.\n",

      "6. Historian/Time Specialist: They can provide context and aid in the 'Passage of Time'.\n",

They could serve as an intermediary for 'Resolution of Unfinished Business', 'Acceptance of Death', 'Reconciliation', 'Release of Guilt', 'Uncovering Truth', 'Protection', 'Forgiveness', and 'Fulfillment of a Promise'. A Medium's ability to communicate directly with ghosts could help facilitate their journey to moving on.\n",

They could potentially help ghosts understand the passage of time since their death, inform them about historical events and changes that have occurred, and help them see the evolution of their surroundings. This could give the ghost a sense of closure and help them come to terms with the changes, aiding in their transition to the other side. Additionally, if the ghost is tied to a specific historical period or event, the Historian could provide important context that could help resolve their issues.\n",

They could serve as an intermediary for 'Resolution of Unfinished Business', 'Acceptance of Death', 'Reconciliation', 'Release of Guilt', 'Uncovering Truth', 'Protection', 'Forgiveness', and 'Fulfillment of a Promise'. A Medium's ability to communicate directly with ghosts could help facilitate their journey to moving on.\n",

They could potentially help ghosts understand the passage of time since their death, inform them about historical events and changes that have occurred, and help them see the evolution of their surroundings. This could give the ghost a sense of closure and help them come to terms with the changes, aiding in their transition to the other side. Additionally, if the ghost is tied to a specific historical period or event, the Historian could provide important context that could help resolve their issues.\n",

They could potentially help ghosts understand the passage of time since their death, inform them about historical events and changes that have occurred, and help them see the evolution of their surroundings. This could give the ghost a sense of closure and help them come to terms with the changes, aiding in their transition to the other side. Additionally, if the ghost is tied to a specific historical period or event, the Historian could provide important context that could help resolve their issues.\n",
